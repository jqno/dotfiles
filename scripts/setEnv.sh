#!/bin/sh

# Allows for the switching of certain specific configuration files between profiles. Currently it supports:
#
# * Maven settings.xml (in ~/.m2/)
# * NPM resource file (in ~/.npmrc)
#
# Available profiles should reside in a subdirectory under ~/.setEnv/, e.g. ~/.setEnv/home contains configuration
# for the profile 'home'. This profile can then be activated by invoking setEnv.sh home
# 
# Trying to switch to a profile that does not exist will have no effect.
#
#
# Configuring Maven settings.xml
# ==============================
#
# Place a file called settings.xml in the profile directory to have it copied to ~/.m2/ on profile activation.
# Before copying the profile version, this script deletes the file at ~/.m2/settings.xml. This means if you do
# not put a settings.xml file in the profile directory, you will end up with a completely default Maven configuration.
#
#
# Configuring NPM resource file
# =============================
#
# There are two ways to switch between NPM resource files: copying files or use the npmrc tool.
#
# 1. Copying files : This works exactly the same as the Maven way described above. Place a file called npmrc
#                    in the profile directory. It will be copied to ~/.npmrc (yes the dot is added during copy).
#                    Leaving the file out will result in no ~/.npmrc file and hence a default NPM configuration
# 2. Using npmrc   : If you have the npmrc utility installed and configured with profiles, this utility can
#                    delegate to it. Create a file ~/.setEnv/use-npmrc to trigger this behavior. Once active,
#                    we either call npmrc with the name of the profile you are currently activating, or we
#                    pass npmrc the name of the profile you specify in the npmrc file inside the profile
#                    directory.
#
#
# Configuring SSH
# ===============
#
# Place a folder called ssh in the profile directory to have its contents symlinked to ~/.ssh on profile activation.
# Before copying the profile version, this script removes the entire ~/.ssh directory. This means if you do not
# have an ssh folder in the profile directory, you will lose all of your ssh configuration.
#
# The directory is symlinked so that any edits you make will be persisted across sessions.
#
#
# Configuring a banner
# ====================
#
# If you want a banner to show up when you are switching to a profile, just create a file called banner inside
# the profile directory. It will be output to the terminal when switching to this profile. No file means no banner.
#
#
# Injecting something into the prompt
# ===================================
#
# If you want to inject a symbol or some text into your prompt when a certain profile is active, just create a file
# called prompt inside the profile directory. It will be copied to the ~/.setEnv directory, where your prompt
# configuration can pick it up.
# Note that this script doesn't actually add it to your prompt; you need to arrange for that yourself.
#
#
# Custom initialization
# =====================
#
# If you need more custom initialization for your profile, create a file called init.sh inside the profile directory.
# It will be called once all the other profile configurations have been properly configured.
#
# If you need to clean up when leaving the current profile (for instance, if you need to shut down a docker container),
# create a file called shutdown.sh inside the profile directory. It will be called right before switching to a new
# profile.
